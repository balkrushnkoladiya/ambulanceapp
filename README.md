This project is divided into 3 sections. The first one is Patient/User for the registration of ambulance and receiving the OXYGEN, PLAZMA, OR BLOOD from the donors. The second one is the Ambulance User, who is responsible to reply to the user when requested and update his status depending upon the availability. Another part of an ambulance driver is to provide first aid via video/voice chat via the website itself. And lastly, there will be a module about the donor, who wishes to donate OXYGEN, BLOOD, or PLAZMA in a particular city with his contact details. Talking about the software requirement, we tried to reduce as much as complexity for the users and decided to host the project on a website that averts the problem of Platform Independent. The data we used for hospitals are from an API named National Hospital Database API which consists of all the details of hospitals all over India. For the real-time location, we are using Websocket.io and for real-time database transfer, we are using Firebase as our backend server. For the map API, we are currently using MapBox API due to it's open-source. And lastly, the whole website is based on React JS which is known for its platform independence.
